Using a colander or strainer, rinse the palak or spinach leaves (250 grams or 0.55 pounds), very well in running water.

2. Boil 3 cups water in a pan, microwave or electric heater. Add ¼ tsp salt to the hot water and stir. Then add the spinach leaves to the hot water. Let the spinach leaves sit in the water for about 1 minute. If doing this on a stove-top, be sure to remove the pan from the hot burner.

3. After 1 minute, strain the spinach leaves.

4. Immediately add the palak or spinach leaves in a pan or bowl containing ice cold water. This method helps in preserving the green color of the spinach. Just add 8 to 10 ice cubes to 3 cups water to get cold water. Allow the spinach leaves to be in the cold water for a minute.

5. Then drain the ice cold water. Add the spinach in a blender or grinder jar with 1 inch chopped ginger, (1 or 2 small to medium) garlic cloves and 1 or 2 chili peppers (green chillies). You can also use a hand-held immersion blender to make the puree.

7. Heat 2 tablespoons oil (or ghee or butter) in a pan or kadai (wok). Here I have used butter. If using butter, melt it on a low flame making sure that it does not brown.

15. Once the tomatoes are softened and you see fat releasing from the sides of the mixture, then add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon red chili powder (or cayenne pepper or paprika) and a pinch of asafoetida (hing). You can find asafoetida at your local spice store or on amazon, but if you don’t have it, you can skip it.

21. Stir and add ¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder.

22. Stir again and then add the paneer cubes (200 to 250 grams cottage cheese). I have added the paneer cubes directly to the gravy. But you can also lightly pan-fry the paneer cubes in some oil until they are lightly browned and then add them to the palak gravy. In this case, you don’t need to cook the paneer further.

23. Mix very well and switch off the heat.

24. Lastly add 2 tablespoons low-fat cream. I used Amul brand cream. If using heavy whipping cream, then add 1 tablespoon of it. You can also add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) at this step, however this is optional.

25. Stir gently again so that the cream gets incorporated in the gravy uniformly.
